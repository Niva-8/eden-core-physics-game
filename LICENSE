✅ These 3 files are now ready to push:
- `package.json`
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`

**Next up:** `/public` — including:
- `index.html`
- `manifest.json`
- Asset folder setup (placeholders)

Shall I continue to the full `/public` files, or would you like to upload these three first to GitHub and Render?
